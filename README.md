# MadLibs-Generator
Generator which asks the user for some words and then replaces them from within the text file to make a sentence. Made in python.

To use the project the python file gets the text file from he folder "Test", so save both files into a folder named "Test" to link the files correctly.

Also it's easy to make your own story, just make any words wanted blank with the format <word>, with the word being what to tell the user to input. Then just link the text file in the first line of code.
